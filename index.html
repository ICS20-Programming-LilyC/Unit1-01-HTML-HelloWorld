    <h4> My favourite pass-time activities </h4>

    <p> In my pass-time I enjoy spending my time in physical activity. Given that we're in February, I have been taking advantage of the outdoor rink that has been constructed down the street from me. I spend my time there practicing for hockey and working on perfecting my techniques. Otherwise, I try to workout to build muscle and improve my endurance abilities for hockey. Since I am part of the school team, I am really focused on helping my team advance in the standings and potentially bring home gold again for MAC!  </p>

    <h4>My least favourite subject</h4>
    <p> This year my least favourite subject would have to be math. I found the curriculum very challenging and wasn't explained well and that it was often rushed through. There were countless occasions where I had to seek extra instructions and guidance from outside sources to fully be able to understand what was being taught to me. Since in my previous years, math was a subject that I could tolerate and do decently in, but this year was different.   </p>
