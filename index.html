<h4> My favourite pass-time activities </h4>

 <p> In my pass-time I enjoy spending my time in phyiscal activity. Given that we're in Febuary, I have been taking advantage of the outdoor rink has been constructed down the street from me. I spend my time there practicing for hockey and working on perfecting my techniques. Ohterwise, I try to workout to build muscle and improve my endurance abilities for hockey. Since I am part of the school team, I am really foucsed on helping my team advance in the standings and potentially bring home gold again for MAC! .  </p>
