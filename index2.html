    <h1>Jewelery making</h1>
   <p> Something that interests me is jewelry making. I love wearing jewelry and it is something that I do daily. I think that it is a great way to express yourself, which is important for me especially since I attend a uniform school. But it's small accessories like jewelry that allow you to show others who you're.</p>

   <p> I have an older cousin who has her own small jewelry making business. I have always admired her talent in jewelry making since I was young, and for my birthday I would always want a jewelry piece from her small business. After being inspired I think it would be so cool to make my own jewelry, since I could customize pieces for myself and others.</p>

    <p>This is her instagram account, where you can see some of the many pieces she has made:</p>

    <p>So this March break I am going to try and pursue this interest of mine, by asking for some jewelry making lessons. I hope that one day in the future that I could have a hobby of jewelry making just like my cousin.</p>
